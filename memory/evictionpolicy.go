Interface for an eviction policy.

When the database server needs to free up a frame to make room for a new page,
it must decide which page to evict from the buffer pool. Eviction Policy decides
which page/frame to evict out of the buffer pool, when the pool is full.

// the system checked.
//
// The clock eviction policy organizes pages in circular buffer with a clock hand that sweeps
// over pages in order. As the hand visits each page, it checks if its ref bit
// is set to 1. If yes, set to zero. If no, then evict.
